# Python Projects

## Introduction

Python is the first programming language I've ever learned. Later on, I tried out a few others such as JavaScript, Java, etc. but it was the simplicity and easy-to-understand aspect of Python that kept me coming back! This repository holds most of the work that I have completed!
