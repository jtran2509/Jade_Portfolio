# Python Projects

## Introduction

Python is the first programming language I've ever learned. Later on, I tried out a few others such as JavaScript, Java, etc. but it was the simplicity and easy-to-understand aspect of Python that kept me coming back! This repository holds most of the work that I have completed!

# Project Examples

## Data Science

# [Project 1: Analyzing eBay Car Sales Data](https://github.com/jtran2509/Jade_Projects/blob/main/Python/Data%20Science/Explore%20eBay%20Car%20Sales/Analyzing%20eBay%20Car%20Sales%20Data.ipynb)

### Project at a Glance

- Background: Exploring different brand of cars based on different aspects (odometer, price, registration year, ect.) of a datset scraped from German eBay Kleinanzeigen.
- Skills: **Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlb**
- Impact: 
  - Clean & analyze **50,000 samples** from a full dataset
  - Making educated conclusion about the relationship between various cars' component and its price

# [Project 2: Finding Advertisement Opportunities - Analyzing different market around the world](https://github.com/jtran2509/best-market-to-advertise)

### Project at a Glance

- Background: determine the 2 best markets to advertise the products of e-course related to web & mobile development by analyzing a datset from [freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder survey](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969/)
- Skills: **Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Statistics**
- Impact: Identify top **2 out of 172** countries to target the advertisement after eliminating more than **50% outliers** from top **4 countries**

# [Project 3: Estimating Car Price Based on Various Car's Aspect using KNN](https://github.com/jtran2509/estimate-car-price)

### Project at a Glance
- Background: Based on different attributes, use KNN model to calculate the RMSE to estimate which technical aspect of the car is the most relevant to its price
- Skills: **Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Statistics, Classification (K-NN)**
- Impact: successfully build a pipeline for both univariate & multivariate model to compute RMSE

# [Project 4: Lottery Addict - Here's our mobile app (prototype)!](https://github.com/jtran2509/lottery-streamlit-heroku)

### Project at a Glance
- Background: based on the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) of the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada (from Kaggle)
- Skills: **Pandas, Numpy, Statistics**
- Impact: Build pipeline to calculate **one-ticket & multi-ticket probability** as well as provide historical data check for users for authenticity.
