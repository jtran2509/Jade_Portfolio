# Python Projects

## Introduction

Python is the first programming language I've ever learned. Later on, I tried out a few others such as JavaScript, Java, etc. but it was the simplicity and easy-to-understand aspect of Python that kept me coming back! At first, I only stumbled upon it on the Internet and decided to give it a try and after researching, I want to dig deeper into it and create value with more projects in the future. This repository holds most of the work that I have completed!
