# Mobile App for Lottery Addiction
**Quick disclaimer**: The scenario is fictional but I want to practice applying the concepts I've learned about conditional 

## Quick Intro
- This analysis is based on the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) of the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada

## Approach
- In this project, what I mostly did was to build function to calculate factorial, combinations, then apply them to calculate one-ticket probability (in case the buyer only buy 1 ticket) and multi-ticket probability (if the buyer aspires to buy multiple ticket - 10, 100, etc).
- In the midway, I also wrote a function called `historical_data_check` so that users (or future developers) put in the number of their ticket and check to see if the same numbers appeared or not.

## Result
- Build pipeline to calculate **one-ticket & multi-ticket probability** as well as provide historical data check for users for authenticity.
-  The **ultimate purpose** is to help the buyer see what the chances are that he will likely to win big prize, 2-3-4-5 winning numbers.
