    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "- Historical data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada.\n",
    "- [The dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) has data for 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018\n",
