# Dung (Jade) Tran - Projects Portfolio

## Index

This repository holds all of my [Data Science]() projects that I've done over the years!

## Background

Hello!

My name is Dung Tran, you can call me Jade or my real name (if you know how to pronounce it PROPERLY, lol) and welcome to my Project Portfolio. A little bit about me. As of 2021, I'm a final year Dental Hygiene student at Fanshawe College in Canada. Although my studies was not related at all to Data Science, I have an urge to learn more about integrating Dental knowledge into technology, in terms of data. Although you haven't seen any Dental projects in my repo, I'm working on scrapping the data because it's not as available as chest X-rays in medical field. Now I'm focusing on gaining more in-depth knowledge by solving whatever problems or dataset come my way.
